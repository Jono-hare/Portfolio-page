# I have no idea what I'm doing
This project is the last of the five projects for FCC's responsive web design certification.

In this final project I have focused on learning & implementing:

1) Bootstrap
2) Git
3) GitHub & GitHub Desktop
4) Moving away from codepen.io and learning VScode text editor.
